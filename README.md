****Spot: Peer-to-Peer Parking Platform****

**Inspiration**
The inspiration for Spot came from the frustration many people face when trying to find parking in bustling urban areas, especially during large events such as concerts or sports games. With the rise of the sharing economy, where people rent out unused spaces in their homes via platforms like Airbnb, we saw a clear opportunity: what if people could rent out their unused parking spots? Whether in dense city centers or around event venues, Spot allows people to make a quick buck by renting out their parking spots while helping drivers find convenient and affordable parking.

**What We Learned**
Throughout the development of Spot, we gained valuable insights into urban infrastructure challenges, particularly around parking. It became clear that a peer-to-peer model could significantly reduce the time and stress involved in finding parking. Additionally, we honed our skills in full-stack development, using modern frameworks like React, Tailwind CSS, and Google Maps API to deliver a seamless user experience. We also deepened our understanding of secure payment processing, user authentication, and data privacy—critical elements for building a trustworthy platform.

**How We Built the Project**
Frontend: We used React to create a dynamic and interactive user interface. Tailwind CSS helped us design a clean and responsive interface efficiently.

**Backend: ** The backend was built using Flask with MongoDB to manage user data, parking spot listings, and transaction history. We ensured that the system could handle multiple user interactions simultaneously.

**Map Integration:** The Google Maps API was integrated to allow users to locate available parking spots with ease.

**Payment Processing:** We implemented secure payment processing through Stripe, ensuring users can safely rent and pay for parking spots.

**Challenges Faced**
Real-Time Availability: One major challenge was ensuring real-time availability of parking spots. Managing data consistency, especially when multiple users were viewing the same spots, required careful backend planning and robust solutions.

Map Service Integration: Integrating a reliable, user-friendly map service was essential. We overcame hurdles with the Google Maps API to ensure smooth and responsive user interactions.

**Conclusion**
Spot solves the problem of finding parking by offering a peer-to-peer solution where users can rent or list parking spots. It creates a win-win scenario—drivers get convenient parking options, and space owners generate extra income.
